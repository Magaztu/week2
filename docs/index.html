        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, 
        in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.

        ‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a <br>
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
        for <br> the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
        The next 12 <br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
        the course, I‚Äôve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù

        ‚Äú I started as a total newbie with <br>virtually no coding skills. I now work <br>as a mobile engineer 
        for a big <br>company. This was one of the best <br>investments I‚Äôve made in myself. ‚Äù

    <h4>
      Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br>themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
      learning from <br>their experiences was easy.
    
    </h4>
    <p>
      ‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br>program 
      gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br>myself as a capable 
      junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal <br>attention you need from 
      an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù

    <h4>
      Such a life-changing <br>experience. Highly <br>recommended!
    </h4>
    <p>
      ‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve <br>never written a line of code. I needed <br>some structure from 
      professionals <br>who can help me learn programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged to <br>enroll by a former 
      student of theirs <br>who can only say wonderful things <br>about the program. The entire <br>curriculum and staff 
      did not <br>disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>and I never had to wait long for <br>assistance. The agile team 
      project, in <br>particular, was outstanding. It took <br>my learning to the next level in a way <br>that no tutorial 
      could ever have. <br>In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during <br>interviews as an example of my <br>developent 
      experience. It certainly <br>helped me land a job as a full-stack <br>developer after receiving multiple <br>offers. 
      100% recommend! ‚Äù
